				<h2>My Interest in IT:</h2>
			</header>

				<section>
					<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>
					<p>I was interested in Information Technology (IT) in my early teens derived from my fascination with technology and the vast repository of information that is the internet. However, I only started to consider it as a course I wanted to pursue during my foundation year at Trinity College of the University of Melbourne. I was initially going for a bachelor of Mechanical Engineering, but after a semester, I understood I was not meant for the field. I have discussed it with my senior, which opened my eyes into the world of IT and founded a new goal to work myself towards.</p>
					<p>First IT job started when I was in my late teens, and have been in IT ever since still bouncing around different areas.</p>

					<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
					<p>Initially, my plan for University was to be studying at the University of Melbourne. However, through further research and talking to some seniors studying a course similar to what I was aiming for, made me realise the teaching style and learning environment was not what I wanted. A friend that was studying at RMIT informed about his experiences doing his Masters Engineering degree. This made me want to consider my course in RMIT.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
					<p>I expect to learn a variety of skills that would assist in my future as someone planning to work in the IT industry. One of the biggest things I hope to learn is team management and efficient project development. The practical experience and hands-on knowledge that RMIT provides in its courses would give me a significant advantage when I head into the job market.</p>

        <a href="url">https://www.seek.com.au/job/50375807?type=promoted#searchRequestToken=75977b57-206444d0-b45d-5bc21bb82d40</a>
        <p>My ideal job would be an Information Security Consultant. An Information security consultant is someone who deals with safeguarding public/private entities digital assets. He/She assesses various systems such as software, computer systems, and network vulnerabilities, then design and implement the best security solution that the entity needs.</p>
		    <p>To start onto the path, I would need to have at least an associate or a full bachelor's degree in Information Technology or one of the other streams relating to digital security. I expect that I would need to have a minimum of 3-5 years of experience in the industry before I could become a consultant. Some of the skills and qualification I need would be: </p>
        <pre>

          Knowledge in security architecture

          Endpoint security skills

          Have familiarity with various operating systems.

          Well versed negotiation and Communication skills, to name a few.

          This is the high learning curve that I need to be able to climb to become an Information Security Consultant.
          Currently, I only have a rudimentary understanding of C++, python and HTML coding languages.
          I have no qualification nor proper experience in the IT world.
