				<h2>My Interest in IT:</h2>
			</header>

				<section>
					<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>
					<p>I was interested in Information Technology (IT) in my early teens derived from my fascination with technology and the vast repository of information that is the internet. However, I only started to consider it as a course I wanted to pursue during my foundation year at Trinity College of the University of Melbourne. I was initially going for a bachelor of Mechanical Engineering, but after a semester, I understood I was not meant for the field. I have discussed it with my senior, which opened my eyes into the world of IT and founded a new goal to work myself towards.</p>
					<p>First IT job started when I was in my late teens, and have been in IT ever since still bouncing around different areas.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
					<p>Initially, my plan for University was to be studying at the University of Melbourne. However, through further research and talking to some seniors studying a course similar to what I was aiming for, made me realise the teaching style and learning environment was not what I wanted. A friend that was studying at RMIT informed about his experiences doing his Masters Engineering degree. This made me want to consider my course in RMIT.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
					<p>I expect to learn a variety of skills that would assist in my future as someone planning to work in the IT industry. One of the biggest things I hope to learn is team management and efficient project development. The practical experience and hands-on knowledge that RMIT provides in its courses would give me a significant advantage when I head into the job market.</p>

  			<img src="img/1.png" alt="My Ideal Job - Information Security Consultant " width="360" height="270">
        <p> Link to the job page:<p>
        <a href="url">https://www.seek.com.au/job/50375807?type=promoted#searchRequestToken=75977b57-206444d0-b45d-5bc21bb82d40</a>
        <p>My ideal job would be an Information Security Consultant. An Information security consultant is someone who deals with safeguarding public/private entities digital assets. He/She assesses various systems such as software, computer systems, and network vulnerabilities, then design and implement the best security solution that the entity needs.</p>
		    <p>To start onto the path, I would need to have at least an associate or a full bachelor's degree in Information Technology or one of the other streams relating to digital security. I expect that I would need to have a minimum of 3-5 years of experience in the industry before I could become a consultant. Some of the skills and qualification I need would be: </p>
        <pre>

          Knowledge in security architecture

          Endpoint security skills

          Have familiarity with various operating systems.

          Well versed negotiation and Communication skills, to name a few.

        </pre>
        <p> This is the high learning curve that I need to be able to climb to become an Information Security Consultant. Currently, I only have a rudimentary understanding of C++, python and HTML coding languages. I have no qualification nor proper experience in the IT world. <p>
          <p>My current plan is to engage in my course. In doing so, I intend to take-on internships and extra classes related to programming, computer systems and cybersecurity; this would significantly boost my knowledge and understanding in getting to become an IT security consultant. After, University, I  plan to pursue a  lower-level IT position to have more experience and gain practical work skills related to my field. After three years possible go back to University for a Masters in Cyber Security to boost my credibility before going on in either starting my own Cyber-Security Company or gain more practical experience in a more prominent well know Cyber-Security company like Cisco or Symantec.<p>

          <h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
					<p>It accurately represents me as a person. All three results paint a very accurate picture of my learning attitude, personality, and general demeanour. It's not the type of character you would usually expect in an IT related job; however, it could be a great asset for the people I that would work with and me. So these tests do not surprise me.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
          <h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
          <p>My position in the team would be the negotiator and communicator. With the personality of a diplomat, I would do my best to keep the boat from rocking and keeping the team in harmony. Another behaviour I'd exhibit more would be the enthusiastic one pushing my teammates when working on a project. Otherwise, my typical behaviour would not change too drastically.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
          <h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
          <p>When forming a team my main goal would get at least one dedicated logical worker. Someone who takes the project in a more logical and realistic approach to ground the bigger picture. This would at least balance my high ideals and what is actually feasible in reality.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Eksplorador One<h3>
              <p>“Eksplorador one”  roguelike space-adventure program based on command-lines. A real-time strategy/simulation game in which one player explores and navigates a procedurally generated world. The player is a drone fleet operator in the fringes of the galaxy exploring and scavenging various derelict and forgotten ships scattered around the outer reaches of civilised space. The objective of the games is to scavenge, explore, expand the operators fleet, and maybe investigate why there are so many derelicts left in the fringes of humanity. The controls of the game will be a mix of general controls of a typical real-time strategy and the player using command lines to direct and assign tasks to the operator's drone fleet.<p>
                <p>The motivation stems from my deep interest and fascination of strategy and role-playing adventure games. An exciting component of the game will be the implementation of using a command console to interact and control the drones used in the game. There are very few instances of bringing back the old command prompts once prominent in older computer systems but was eventually replaced by windows. The belief is that this would help promote interest from people into programming.<p>
                  <p>The initial primary objective of the game is to pay off the enormous debt garnered by a former partner of the drone operator. To pay off the massive debt owed to the Grant Foundation: they send you off in an old exploratory carrier with a few workers, combat, and control drones to salvage the fleets of derelict ships found in the frontier. The frontier will be a procedurally generated stretch of space consisting of several types of star systems the operator can explore.<p>
                    <p>At the start of the game will consist of the operator and their fleet jumping out of Waypoint, a massive frontier space station at the edge of civilised space. Here is also where the operator sells salvage, performs extensive maintenance on both the carrier and advanced drones, gets newer and better gear for both the ship and the drones and lastly pays the Grant foundation a part of the operator's debt or else be hunted down by the Grant Foundations Hunter-Killer debt collection squadron. The systems outside the Waypoint are all procedurally generated mixed with random events. These events may be useful (for example, encountering a random debris field contain valuable scavenge floating in space), neutral (another scavenging ship passing by informing the operator of something such as an event occurring in a nearby system), or bad (a pirate ambush, solar flare, sudden malfunction in the carrier, etc.). The primary aspect of the gameplay will be exploration and scavenging derelict ships in the fringes of the frontier. The later is performed by both selecting and inputting commands on drones to salvage a ship. This process is not instant or a method of click and forget the operator has to do several steps to salvage a vessel such as:<p>
                        <pre>

                          > sending drones inside to deactivate any systems still operating,
                          > shutting of volatile engineering systems and automated defences
                          > killing unknown and random entities in the ship (pirate scavengers, alien lifeforms automated defence drones.
                          > managing and deciding which cargo is more valuable to sell at Waypoint etc.

                        </pre>
                          <p>The efficient management of this aspect of the game is critical in fulfilling the primary objective of the game. More exploration may lead to scripted events with in-depth lore about the game and massive payout or losses to the operator if it goes poorly.<p>
                            <p>Another significant aspect of the gameplay is the technological progression of the operator's ship and a fleet of drones. Early on the operator only has a small number of drones equipped with a small amount of modifications and abilities. It is up to the operator to slowly upgrade his/her little fleet to be able to take in a broader variety of tasks as this will help in the end goal of paying off the operator's debt as he/she can take on larger contracts dealing with massive vessels like Capital-ships and large intergalactic cargo containers.<p>
                              <p>Lastly, the player may be forced in several combat-related events. For example, a pirate ship ambushes the operator out of the blue and is significantly better equipped; the operator may be forced to use worker drones to take damage to protect the carrier. Such actions may result in the loss of the drone and all modifications but the continued operation of the carrier.<p>
                                <p>The software that will be used in the development would be the Unity Engine (Cite Unity Website). In terms of hardware, a mid-range to a slightly higher-end model pc would be appropriate. Here are a few hardware components:<p>
                                  <pre>

                                    > Dedicated GPU: Nividia GeForce 1050 -1080ti
                                    >CPU: Intel Core i5 7400 - intel core i7-9700k
                                    >RAM: VENGEANCE® LPX 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4 DRAM 3200MHz C16 Memory Kit
                                    >Hardrive: 870 QVO SATA III 2.5" SSD 1TB
                                    >MSI MPG Z490 Gaming Carbon WiFi Others would include a heavy-duty Power, a fan cooler, and a PC case.

                                  </pre>
                                    <p>Skills required in game development:<p>
                                      <p>Communication skills Critical skills (accepting and giving constructive feedback) Presentation skills Storytelling skills Basic visual design skills Basic drawing skills Basic scripting or programming skills User interface designing skills Strategic thinking skills Moderate fluency in 2D and 3D animation and graphics packages Awareness of game platforms and the technology out there Understanding of gameplay theory<p>
                                        <p>The successful outcome of the project would be a great learning experience for me. For it shall teach valuable It-project related skills such as reinforcing IT skills(programming, video graphics and hardware), promote a problem-solving aptitude and introduce practical time management skills.<p>
