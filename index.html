				<h2>My Interest in IT:</h2>
			</header>

				<section>
					<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>
					<p>I was interested in Information Technology (IT) in my early teens derived from my fascination with technology and the vast repository of information that is the internet. However, I only started to consider it as a course I wanted to pursue during my foundation year at Trinity College of the University of Melbourne. I was initially going for a bachelor of Mechanical Engineering, but after a semester, I understood I was not meant for the field. I have discussed it with my senior, which opened my eyes into the world of IT and founded a new goal to work myself towards.</p>
					<p>First IT job started when I was in my late teens, and have been in IT ever since still bouncing around different areas.</p>

				<section>
					<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
					<p>Initially, my plan for University was to be studying at the University of Melbourne. However, through further research and talking to some seniors studying a course similar to what I was aiming for, made me realise the teaching style and learning environment was not what I wanted. A friend that was studying at RMIT informed about his experiences doing his Masters Engineering degree. This made me want to consider my course in RMIT.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
					<p>I expect to learn a variety of skills that would assist in my future as someone planning to work in the IT industry. One of the biggest things I hope to learn is team management and efficient project development. The practical experience and hands-on knowledge that RMIT provides in its courses would give me a significant advantage when I head into the job market.</p>

        <a href="url">https://www.seek.com.au/job/50375807?type=promoted#searchRequestToken=75977b57-206444d0-b45d-5bc21bb82d40</a>
        <p>My ideal job would be an Information Security Consultant. An Information security consultant is someone who deals with safeguarding public/private entities digital assets. He/She assesses various systems such as software, computer systems, and network vulnerabilities, then design and implement the best security solution that the entity needs.</p>
		    <p>To start onto the path, I would need to have at least an associate or a full bachelor's degree in Information Technology or one of the other streams relating to digital security. I expect that I would need to have a minimum of 3-5 years of experience in the industry before I could become a consultant. Some of the skills and qualification I need would be: </p>
        <pre>

          Knowledge in security architecture

          Endpoint security skills

          Have familiarity with various operating systems.

          Well versed negotiation and Communication skills, to name a few.

        </pre>
        <p> This is the high learning curve that I need to be able to climb to become an Information Security Consultant. <br> Currently, I only have a rudimentary understanding of C++, python and HTML coding languages. I have no qualification nor proper experience in the IT world. <p>
          <p>My current plan is to engage in my course. In doing so, I intend to take-on internships and extra classes related to programming, computer systems and cybersecurity; this would significantly boost my knowledge and understanding in getting to become an IT security consultant.<p>
            <p>After, University, I  plan to pursue a  lower-level IT position to have more experience and gain practical work skills related to my field. After three years possible go back to University for a Masters in Cyber Security to boost my credibility before going on in either starting my own Cyber-Security Company or gain more practical experience in a more prominent well know Cyber-Security company like Cisco or Symantec.<p>

          <h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
					<p>It accurately represents me as a person. All three results paint a very accurate picture of my learning attitude, personality, and general demeanour. It's not the type of character you would usually expect in an IT related job; however, it could be a great asset for the people I that would work with and me. So these tests do not surprise me.</p>
